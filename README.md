# Welcome to SNBS!

This is an example application for our hypothetical Serve and Be Served website (final ORF 401 project). Our website showcases a peer-to-peer marketplace for Princeton University. Our website is based on Miguel Grenberg's [Flask Mega-Tutorial](https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-i-hello-world).
